# How we calculated All Children’s surgical mortality rates

To better understand the outcomes at Johns Hopkins All Children's Hospital in 2017, we calculated the annual outcomes for All Children’s and compared its heart center to every children’s heart surgery program in Florida.

This repo contains the Python code used to analyze 10 years of discharge data obtained from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration. It also contains the results of those calculations. It does not contain the underlying data because we are not allowed to publish it under the contract we sign with the state agency to protect patient privacy.
